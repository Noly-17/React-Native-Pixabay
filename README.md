To Start go to the "React Native Pixabay" Folder
and follow this directory:

React Native Pixabay/redux/saga

and you will see a variable apiKey. You should put an API KEY in that
particular variable to use the app and run it.

after setting up the api key you can now type in the "npm run android" command
on the terminal to start the application.
